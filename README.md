# winequality-red-simple-linear-regression-
In the wine quality data, the dependent varible(Y) is wine quality and the independent (X) varible we have chosen is alcohol content.
WE are testing here whether there is any significant relation between both, to check whether c change in alcohol percentage is the decideing factor
in the quality of the wine.
Data

The two data sets containing physicochemical and sensory characteristics of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine were taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. These data sets are the courtesy of Paulo Cortez.

There are 1599 samples of red wine and 4898 samples of white wine in the data sets. Each wine sample (row) has the following characteristics (columns):

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulphates
    Alcohol
    Quality (score between 0 and 10)

Goals and work flow

By the means of data management, visualization, analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning, I explore the relationships and correlations between the wine characteristics and its quality score. The main focus of this work is to try different predictive algorithms on the data and examine the resutls.

The work flows through the following sections:

    Data management and visualization
    Data analysis
    Regression modeling
    Machine learning
